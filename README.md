# RubiksCubeJS
This is a JavaScript Rubik's Cube that I created for my senior capstone at [Simpson College.](https://simpson.edu/academics/departments/academics/departments/department-computer-science/computer-science)

You can see the progress [here!](https://drewroen.github.io/RubiksCubeJS/)

# Goal
The goal is to create a cube that people can input a scrambled cube and get a solution based on different solving methods, rather than a mathematical solution.
